# cps-monthly-stata-prep
Census stores CPS basic monthly microdata files as archived (e.g., ZIP, gZIP) flat files. Accessing particular features requires the use of accompanying data dictionaries that may change over time, causing variable names, locations, and lengths to vary as well. This Python script prepares CPS monthly data for analysis in Stata, a popular econometrics tool used by economists. It downloads individual archives and extracts them (Stata will have to import them). In addition, Stata uses specific "dictionary" files (.dct) to read in fixed-format data. This script associates monthly files with the relevant technical documentation, reads the technical documentation, and creates a .dct file using variable location and length information from the technical documentation. Users can specifiy a list of variable names to retain and the program does the rest.
